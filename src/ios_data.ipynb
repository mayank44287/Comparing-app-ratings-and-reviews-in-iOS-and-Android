      "    text: 'I downloaded houseparty maybe two years ago and one of the great things about it is you get the chance to talk to people you wouldn’t usually talk to or call on purpose and you make a lot of new friends this way. One of my best friends to this day I would’ve never thought of talking to if it hadn’t been for houseparty. It’s a great app overall the only reason it lost that star was because of what it did with streaks. It started off cool like you and your friends would try to rack up minutes and because it was every five days in circumstances where they couldn’t be on house party I felt it was a good amount of time to give. But then they began decreasing it to three and then two days which means you basically have to be on the app everyday in order to keep your minutes or streak or whatever. It’s not really the fact that minutes and aesthetic were lost but more of the passive aggressive way to keep people on the app. Minutes were one out of many of my motivations to go back to the app knowing i had a good amount of time, but now there’s no motivation if you’re just going to lose them every two days. But overall it is still a very good app and helpful in making new friends',\n",

You can message your friends through the app, which I find very convenient. Speaking of friends, on the app somebody has to request to be your friend, so thistles the app slightly more private then it already is. The quality of the video is very good. Houseparty has the same qualities as the app “FaceTime” and more. You can play games with your friend that the app serves to you while on a call with your friend. You can make group conversations on the messaging part of the app. And to wrap it up, you can call other friends that are on the app, from the app, and you can also just do an audio call. There are many more great things about housparty that I can’t fit into one review. So I definitely recommend this app for any age group. (It is not at all inappropriate or to mature for anyone that is able to use “FaceTime” or “Messages”). The app is very accommodating!!! And awesome!!',\n",

Sometimes I want to video chat with multiple people at the same time but I can’t do that with FaceTime. I can with Houseparty! There are little things here in there but I love this app! One time these two people would not stop calling me and anytime I would come on they would join me, but you can sneak onto Houseparty. See, anytime you go onto the app your friends get a notification, but there is a way to sneak on, so your friends don’t get a notification. Also, they give you really cool facts on the home screen, one time I spent hours just looking at the facts! Lastly, if you don’t like getting notifications every time one of your friends comes on, there is a way to do turn it off. Overall, I love this app and I don’t know why more people are using this app. It’s a great app to download and I recommend this app to anyone!',\n",

Houseparty allowed us who couldn’t be there physically to be there virtually during precious moments. We were able to say our last goodbyes, hear funny stories, comfort one another, and be there for his final breath. Death is not fun but this app was one piece of making it a little more bearable because we were literally able to be there for one another. Even on different time zones, doing different things, we were all there. That is something that we are all thankful for and will never forget.

Second, it doesn’t work if you don’t have WiFi........? what if you want to talk with your family members as a group in one chat and you can’t because you don’t have WiFi. It’s very annoying how apps don’t let you play or do things on it without WiFi. It’s very annoying, and for me growing up with not that much WiFi in my household, it really annoys me of how I always have to have it. Third, the app will also don’t work if you have slow WiFi. What I meant with growing up with not that much WiFi in my household, I meant it was very slow. Sure now it fast but still. What about other people. They just want to enjoy their time. Not from worrying if their WiFi is bad. So this is my opinion. I am only 11 years old and I still have my judgments.',\n",

One issue I have is that if someone wants to join in to video chat with you, the app doesn’t ask permission if your screen is open. It automatically just begins a video chat session and that could be awkward at times. I was in the middle of brushing my teeth and the screen just popped on bc I’d opened it to see who was online. I really feel like there should be a delay where permission is asked and either granted or denied. It shouldn’t just open up into a chat like that. It’s a bit weird.

For example my Houseparty and my friends Houseparty on the MacBook is really bad, for one of my friends so bad that she can’t even open it. Another thing it’s not even an app that you can download on the App Store it’s a link that you can send to your email, but the thing is what happens if you don’t have an email, you have to think about these things because some people in Houseparty are little and they just want to talk to their friends. Also there is no way to log out on your Mac to switch to other accounts and on top of that you can’t invite anyone to rooms, receive messages, and send messages. These are all the things I ask to make it better. \\n\\nPs: my friend also sent a review for filters and you said they were gonna come out soon but I still see no sight of that.',\n",

Another being that the audio is sometimes awful to the point where you cannot hear what the person is saying. It cuts out at random points throughout and it gets hard to understand.

I just have a few questions. How do you sneak into the app? I have a few friends on this app, that anytime I go on the app they join me. Not that I don’t love my friends or anything, it can just get annoying sometimes. I have looked in house rules and it tells me to pull down the notification but what notification?! Also how do you make a face mail? When I try to it says turn device around to record. So I do that and nothing happens and sometimes it is very important. One time I couldn’t reach one of my friends because she wasn’t on her phone. It would be helpful if you put how to make a face mail in the House rules.

The games with your loved ones on this really helps to temporarily forget the stressful times we have living in. However, there are some really annoying aspects of this app. 1) Way. Too. Many. Notifications. The notifications settings in the app are very limited. I get a notification every time a new Facebook friend joins the app. It’s extremely annoying. I’m probably going into my iPhone settings and completely disable notifications for the app entirely until the fix it. 2) the app isn’t intuitive and user friendly. Even for me who is super techie, it’s a trial and error of pushing buttons to navigate around. My older relatives would definitely not be able to figure this out alone. The user experience should be improved a bit.',\n",

Such as if the user is a male, they give you facts specifically for males or if you are a female, it gives you facts specifically for females. I have been given many inappropriate facts and just facts in general that aren’t appropriate for children even though this app is advertised for 9+.

It requires closing the app and reopening it. Also, I wish there weren’t so many gestures, as everyone always accidentally swipes out of a room. It’s a feature none of us use (why would we be going in and out of chats like that?) And if you guys could tone it down with the amount of notifications this app produces, that would be great. Other than that this app is still way better than FaceTime, which has become gimmicky junk over the years.

One of my best friends to this day I would’ve never thought of talking to if it hadn’t been for houseparty. It’s a great app overall the only reason it lost that star was because of what it did with streaks. It started off cool like you and your friends would try to rack up minutes and because it was every five days in circumstances where they couldn’t be on house party I felt it was a good amount of time to give. But then they began decreasing it to three and then two days which means you basically have to be on the app everyday in order to keep your minutes or streak or whatever. It’s not really the fact that minutes and aesthetic were lost but more of the passive aggressive way to keep people on the app. Minutes were one out of many of my motivations to go back to the app knowing i had a good amount of time, but now there’s no motivation if you’re just going to lose them every two days.

I am pretty sure that there's no problem with my phone nor with my internet connection, because everything else on my phone works perfectly fine. Let's not mention how late my messages are. This happens every day: I send a dozen messages and neither of those are appearing on my screen and I have to wait up a bit until they're sent. And the pen - it's just horrible. I saw that now I can change the thickness of it, but it is terrible anyway - the previous version of it was undoubtely better. I saw people talking about how new updates removed everything that made Messenger unique and the reasons why people still used it even though apps such as WhatsApp and Viber are more popular nowadays. I remember when Messenger used to be my favorite app for chatting. I've been using it for past 5 years on a daily basis.
